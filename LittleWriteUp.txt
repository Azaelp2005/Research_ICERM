ANALYZING & OPTIMIZING EFFICIENCY OF SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS

A1. Framework to eliminate food insecurity using C1:
Meal debt (downward trend),
Test Scores (upward trend),
Attendance (upward trend)

B1. Keep an eye on:
Correlation /= Causation 
Budget Constraints

C1. Factors that affect outcomes (A1) :
Free school lunch program ~~~ Should be used to optimize A1 

Training Data (Use this to make optimized model for C1):
Regions that try universal lunch
Regions that removed universal lunch

Testing the optimized model with:
Future budget allocations
Potential budgets for USLPS
